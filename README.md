## Hi, I'm Trevor ðŸ‘‹
I&rsquo;m an accessibility engineer with a bad automation habit. Reading a baker&rsquo;s dozen books, finishing none ever. I&rsquo;ll start blogging again (eventually) at [continuumdesign.net](https://continuumdesign.net)

## In the meantime, here's my avatar

![AI-generated hero image. The character looks like a cross between David Hasselhoff and Wolverine. He has a blue A-shirt and looks like he could deadlift about 700 pounds.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94392fb1-d7fb-428d-b484-a5fabf576dc6)

## What?
I was talking one afternoon with [Homer, aka xirclebox](https://github.com/xirclebox) and [Robin, aka mottie](https://github.com/mottie) about language and accents. Mottie had a funny story about pronunciation and said my name would be **Trevor Fierce**. Naturally Homer put this prompt through an AI generator and well, the previous image was the result.

The best part? Homer also said my avatar looked

> &ldquo;Like David Hasselhoff meets Wolverine&hellip;&rdquo;
